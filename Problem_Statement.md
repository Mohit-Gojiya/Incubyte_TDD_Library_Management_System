## Objective

Create a simple library management system that allows users to perform basic operations such as adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and viewing available books.

## Requirements

- ***Add Books:***
  - Users should be able to add new books to the library.
  - Each book should have a unique identifier (e.g., ISBN), title, author, and publication year.


- ***Borrow Books:***
    - Users should be able to borrow a book from the library.
    - The system should ensure that the book is available before allowing it to be borrowed.
    - If the book is not available, the system should raise an appropriate error.


- ***Return Books:***
    - Users should be able to return a borrowed book.
    - The system should update the availability of the book accordingly.


- ***View Available Books:***
    - Users should be able to view a list of all available books in the library.

## Instructions

- ***Code Only:***
    - This is a code-only kata. Focus on writing clean, maintainable code and implementing the required features. Do not spend time creating any user interface.


- ***Test-Driven Development (TDD):***
    - Write tests before implementing the functionality. Follow the three laws of TDD:
        - **Red:** Write a failing test case.
        - **Green:** Write code to pass the test case.
        - **Refactor:** Refactor the code while keeping the tests passing.
    - Ensure that all tests pass before considering the implementation complete.
    - Aim for high test coverage and meaningful test cases.


- ***Clean Coding Practices:***
    - Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
    - Follow SOLID principles and other best practices in software design.
    - Ensure the code is well-documented with meaningful comments and clear variable/method names.


- ***Git Usage:***
    - Use Git for version control.
    - Create a Git repository for your project.
    - Commit your changes frequently with meaningful commit messages to show your TDD journey.
    - Push your code to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and share the repository link.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Languages: Implement the system in one of the following languages:**
    - Ruby
    - Java
    - TypeScript
    - Python


- **Assessment Focus:**
    - Adherence to TDD principles.
    - Frequency and quality of Git commits.
    - Clean coding practices.
    - Proper use of language-specific features and idioms.

## Deliverables

- A Git repository link containing the source code for the library management system.
- A README file explaining how to set up and run the project.
- A test report showing the results of the test cases.
